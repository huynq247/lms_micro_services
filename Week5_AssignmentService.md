# 🎯 WEEK 5: ASSIGNMENT SERVICE

**Focus**: Assignment & Progress Tracking Service
**Timeline**: Week 5 (7 days)
**Port**: 8004
**Database**: PostgreSQL

## 🏗️ PROJECT STRUCTURE

### FastAPI Setup
- [x] Create assignment-service directory
- [x] Setup FastAPI project structure
- [x] Configure PostgreSQL connection
- [x] Setup Alembic for migrations
- [x] Create base models and schemas

## 🗄️ DATABASE SCHEMA

### Tables Design
- [x] Assignments table (id, instructor_id, student_id, content_type, content_id, assigned_at, due_date, status)
- [x] Progress table (id, assignment_id, completed_items, total_items, completion_percentage, last_accessed)
- [x] StudySessions table (id, assignment_id, student_id, started_at, ended_at, items_studied)

### Relationships
- [x] Assignments → Progress (1:1)
- [x] Assignments → StudySessions (1:many)
- [x] Foreign key constraints

---

## 📋 ASSIGNMENT MANAGEMENT

### Assignment Endpoints (6 endpoints)
- [x] Create assignment endpoint (course/deck to student)
- [x] Get assignment by ID endpoint
- [x] List assignments by instructor endpoint
- [x] List assignments by student endpoint
- [x] Update assignment endpoint
- [x] Delete assignment endpoint

### Assignment Logic
- [x] Support course assignments
- [x] Support deck assignments
- [x] Due date management
- [x] Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed)

---

## 📊 PROGRESS TRACKING

### Progress Endpoints (4 endpoints)
- [x] Update progress endpoint
- [x] Get progress by assignment endpoint
- [x] Get student overall progress endpoint
- [x] Mark assignment complete endpoint

### Progress Calculation
- [x] Calculate completion percentage
- [x] Track items completed vs total
- [x] Update last accessed timestamp
- [x] Handle progress milestones

---

## 📚 STUDY SESSIONS

### Study Session Endpoints (4 endpoints)
- [x] Start study session endpoint
- [x] Update session progress endpoint
- [x] End study session endpoint
- [x] Get session history endpoint

### Session Management
- [x] Track session duration
- [x] Record items studied
- [x] Calculate session metrics
- [x] Support multiple concurrent sessions

---

## 📈 ANALYTICS

### Analytics Endpoints (4 endpoints)
- [x] Get instructor dashboard data endpoint
- [x] Get student progress summary endpoint
- [x] Get completion statistics endpoint
- [x] Get learning analytics endpoint

### Analytics Calculations
- [x] Completion rates
- [x] Average study time
- [x] Performance trends
- [x] Class progress overview

---

## 🔄 SERVICE COMMUNICATION

### External Service Integration
- [x] Integrate with Auth Service (user validation)
- [x] Integrate with Content Service (content validation)
- [ ] Handle service communication errors
- [ ] Implement retry logic

### Event Publishing
- [ ] Publish assignment created events
- [ ] Publish progress updated events
- [ ] Publish completion events
- [ ] Handle event failures

---

## 🧪 TESTING

### Test Coverage
- [ ] Unit tests for assignment logic
- [ ] Integration tests for endpoints
- [ ] Test progress tracking
- [ ] Test analytics calculations
- [ ] Test service communication
- [ ] Test event publishing

### Test Scenarios
- [ ] Create and assign content
- [ ] Track student progress
- [ ] Calculate completion rates
- [ ] Handle edge cases

---
