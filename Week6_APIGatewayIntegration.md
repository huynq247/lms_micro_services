# üåê WEEK 6: API GATEWAY & COMMUNICATION

**Focus**: Service Integration & Communication
**Timeline**: Week 6 (7 days)
**Gateway Port**: 80/443
**Technology**: Traefik + RabbitMQ

---

## üö™ TRAEFIK CONFIGURATION

### API Gateway Setup
- [x] Configure routing rules for all services
- [x] Setup load balancing
- [ ] Configure SSL certificates (self-signed for dev)
- [x] Setup middleware for CORS
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

### Routing Rules
```yaml
# Auth Service
/api/auth/* ‚Üí auth-service:8001

# Content Service  
/api/content/* ‚Üí content-service:8002

# Assignment Service
/api/assignments/* ‚Üí assignment-service:8004
```

### Gateway Features
- [x] Request/response logging
- [x] Health check aggregation
- [ ] Service discovery integration
- [ ] Circuit breaker pattern

---

## üì® SERVICE COMMUNICATION

### RabbitMQ Setup
- [ ] Setup RabbitMQ message queues
- [ ] Configure exchanges and routing keys
- [ ] Implement event publishing
- [ ] Implement event subscribers
- [ ] Test inter-service communication

### Event Types
```yaml
# User Events
user.created
user.updated
user.deleted

# Content Events
course.created
deck.created
lesson.created
flashcard.created

# Assignment Events
assignment.created
assignment.completed
progress.updated
```

### Message Patterns
- [ ] Publish/Subscribe for notifications
- [ ] Request/Response for data queries
- [ ] Event sourcing for audit trail
- [ ] Dead letter queue for failures

---

## üìö API DOCUMENTATION

### OpenAPI Integration
- [ ] Configure OpenAPI docs for each service
- [ ] Setup unified API documentation
- [ ] Add request/response examples
- [ ] Document authentication flows

### Documentation Features
- [ ] Interactive API testing
- [ ] Code generation examples
- [ ] Error response documentation
- [ ] Rate limiting information

---

## üîç HEALTH CHECKS

### Service Monitoring
- [x] Implement health check endpoints for each service
- [ ] Configure service discovery
- [x] Setup monitoring endpoints
- [ ] Create health check dashboard

### Health Check Types
- [x] Database connectivity
- [ ] External service availability
- [ ] Resource utilization
- [ ] Service dependencies

---

## üîí SECURITY INTEGRATION

### Cross-Service Security
- [ ] JWT token validation at gateway
- [ ] Service-to-service authentication
- [ ] API key management
- [ ] Request signing verification

### Security Middleware
- [ ] Authentication middleware
- [ ] Authorization middleware
- [ ] Rate limiting by user/IP
- [ ] Request sanitization

---

## üìä MONITORING & LOGGING

### Centralized Logging
- [ ] Configure log aggregation
- [ ] Setup structured logging
- [ ] Implement correlation IDs
- [ ] Create log analysis dashboards

### Metrics Collection
- [ ] Request/response metrics
- [ ] Service performance metrics
- [ ] Error rate monitoring
- [ ] Business metrics tracking

---

## üß™ INTEGRATION TESTING

### Service Integration Tests
- [x] Test complete user workflows
- [x] Test inter-service communication
- [ ] Test event-driven updates
- [x] Test error handling scenarios

### Load Testing
- [ ] API Gateway performance
- [ ] Service-to-service communication
- [ ] Database connection pooling
- [ ] Message queue throughput

---

## üîÑ WORKFLOW TESTING

### End-to-End Scenarios
- [ ] User registration ‚Üí Login ‚Üí Create content
- [ ] Content creation ‚Üí Assignment ‚Üí Progress tracking
- [ ] Instructor dashboard ‚Üí Student analytics
- [ ] Error scenarios and recovery

### Business Workflows
```yaml
Scenario 1: Admin creates instructor
Scenario 2: Instructor creates student  
Scenario 3: Instructor creates course
Scenario 4: Instructor assigns content
Scenario 5: Student studies assigned content
Scenario 6: Progress tracking and analytics
```

---

## üìà PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION

### Gateway Optimization
- [ ] Connection pooling
- [ ] Response caching
- [ ] Request compression
- [ ] Static content serving

### Service Optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Response payload optimization
- [ ] Async processing where applicable
- [ ] Memory usage optimization
