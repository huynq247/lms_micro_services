Assignment 13: Created, progress updated, session started & ended, deleted

================================================================================
üìà PROGRESS TABLE DATA:
================================================================================

Progress records created for each assignment:
- assignment_id: Matching assignment IDs 1-13
- student_id: 1 (consistent test student)
- total_items: 10 (standard test value)
- completed_items: 3 (30% completion)
- completion_percentage: 30.0
- sessions_count: Updated when sessions created
- total_study_time_minutes: Updated from session durations
- last_accessed: Auto-generated timestamps
- created_at/updated_at: Auto-generated

Specific Progress Updates:
- All test assignments received 30% completion update
- Session counts incremented when study sessions started
- Study time accumulated from session durations

================================================================================
üéØ STUDY_SESSIONS TABLE DATA:
================================================================================

Session ID: 1-10 (Sequential creation)

Session 1: Assignment 4, Student 1
- started_at: Auto-generated timestamp
- ended_at: null (session not properly ended)
- duration_minutes: null
- items_studied: 0
- is_active: true/false

Session 2: Assignment 7, Student 1  
- started_at: Auto-generated timestamp
- ended_at: Failed to end (422 error initially)
- duration_minutes: null initially
- items_studied: 0
- is_active: true initially

Session 3-9: Various assignments during debugging
- Similar pattern: started successfully
- Some ended successfully, some failed during debugging phase

Session 10: Assignment 13, Student 1
- started_at: Latest timestamp
- ended_at: Successfully ended
- duration_minutes: Calculated automatically (1-2 minutes)
- items_studied: 5 (from test input)
- is_active: false (properly ended)
- session_notes: null

================================================================================
üîß TEST DATA PATTERNS:
================================================================================

Standard Test Assignment Data:
```json
{
    "title": "Test Assignment",
    "description": "This is a test assignment for development",
    "content_type": "course", 
    "content_id": 123,
    "instructor_id": 2,
    "student_id": 1,
    "status": "pending",
    "priority": "medium",
    "difficulty_level": "intermediate", 
    "estimated_duration_minutes": 60,
    "due_date": "2025-08-22T00:00:00Z"
}
```

Standard Progress Update Data:
```json
{
    "total_items": 10,
    "completed_items": 3,
    "completion_percentage": 30.0
}
```

Standard Session End Data:

    "items_studied": 5
}
```

================================================================================
üóÇÔ∏è DATABASE OPERATIONS PERFORMED:
================================================================================

CREATE Operations:
- 13 INSERT into assignments table
- 13 INSERT into progress table  
- 10 INSERT into study_sessions table

UPDATE Operations:
- 13 UPDATE progress records (completion percentage)
- Multiple UPDATE on assignments (status changes)
- Multiple UPDATE on study_sessions (ending sessions)
- Session count increments in progress table

DELETE Operations:
- Multiple soft DELETE (is_active = false) on assignments
- Cleanup operations after each test cycle

SELECT Operations:
- Hundreds of SELECT queries for:
  - Assignment retrieval by ID
  - Progress checking
  - Session status verification
  - List operations
  - Analytics queries

================================================================================
üé≤ ANALYTICS DATA GENERATED:
================================================================================

Through analytics endpoints, the following computed data was generated:
- Instructor statistics (assignment counts by status)
- Student session summaries (total time, session counts)
- Learning analytics (completion rates, engagement scores)
- Assignment-specific statistics

Note: Analytics data is computed on-demand, not stored as separate records.

================================================================================
üìù DATA PERSISTENCE STATUS:
================================================================================

PERSISTENT DATA (Remains in database):
- Assignments with is_active = true
- All progress records
- All study session records (active and completed)

SOFT-DELETED DATA:
- Assignments with is_active = false (test cleanup)

COMPUTED DATA:
- Analytics results (calculated real-time)
- Aggregated statistics (not persisted)

================================================================================
üîç FINAL DATABASE STATE:
================================================================================

Expected current state after all tests:
- assignments: ~3-5 active records, ~8-10 soft-deleted
- progress: ~13 records total
- study_sessions: ~10 records total (mix of completed/incomplete)

Test Student Profile (student_id: 1):
- Multiple assignment completions at 30%
- 10 study sessions recorded
- Varying session durations (1-2 minutes each)
- Total study time: ~10-20 minutes accumulated

Test Instructor Profile (instructor_id: 2):
- Created 13 assignments total
- Mix of assignment statuses
- Analytics showing completion rates and activity
